# Spelling

This project is written in Ruby. It uses the `say` command on
Macs to say and spell words that my daugther needs to learn
for school.

## Features

- Uses `say` command on Macs
- Spelling words are kept in a words directory so it's easy to add new ones
- Very simple interface for kids
- Only repeats words that are missed
- Makes it easier on us (my wife and I) to work on spelling with our daugther
